Howto setup squash to be run.

First, have squash copied into your path.  (But I didn't need to tell you that).

Next setup your configuration file.  There is an example configuration file,
'extra/squash.conf'.  Squash will look in '/etc/squash.conf', '~/squash.conf',
and SQUASH_CONF (environment variable) for configuration settings and in that
order.

Now you need to bulid the database.  The currently provided tools do not support
putting these files in a separate directory tree (even though squash supports
having those files in a separate directory tree).  My suggestion is to fix the
tools or to use tar to move the files after they are created.

To create the database just run import_music.rb with the directory name that
contains your music.  Note you need to run import_music.rb from the same path
as the file musicdb_lib.rb .  Or you can move musicdb_lib.rb into a directory
in your RUBYPATH.

Now you can run squash.  Please enjoy.
