Howto setup squash to be run.

First, have squash copied into your path.  (But I didn't need to tell you that).

Next setup your configuration file.  There is an example configuration file,
'extra/squash.conf'.  Squash will look in '/etc/squash.conf', '~/squash.conf',
and SQUASH_CONF (environment variable) for configuration settings and in that
order.

Now you need to bulid the database.  The currently provided tools do not support
putting these files in a separate directory tree (even though squash supports
having those files in a separate directory tree).  My suggestion is to fix the
tools (since they aren't very well writ anyway) or to use tar to move the files
after they are created.

To create the database just run both ogg_to_info.rb and mp3_to_info.rb with the
directory name that contains your music.

Now you can run squash.  Please enjoy.
