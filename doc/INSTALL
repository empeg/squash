How to setup squash to be run.  Please see empeg/INSTALL for notes about
installing squash on the empeg.

First, have squash copied into your path.  (But I didn't need to tell
you that).

Next setup your configuration file.  There is an example configuration
file, 'extra/squash.conf'.  Squash will look in '/etc/squash.conf',
'~/squash.conf', and SQUASH_CONF (environment variable) for configuration
settings and in that order.  You should look at USERS_GUIDE for more
details.

Now you need to build the database (see below, using the ruby-based
external tools is optional).  The currently provided tools do not support
putting these files in a separate directory tree (even though squash
supports having those files in a separate directory tree).  My suggestion
is to fix the tools or to use tar to move the files after they are
created.

To create the database just run import_music.rb with the directory name
that contains your music.  Note you need to run import_music.rb from the
same path as the file musicdb_lib.rb .  Or you can move musicdb_lib.rb
into a directory in your RUBYPATH.

Additionally, you may choose not to run the import_music.rb script and
just run squash directly.  Support has been added to read OGG, FLAC and
MP3 files directly so there is no need to do it by hand if you do not
wish to.

Now you can run squash.  Please enjoy.
