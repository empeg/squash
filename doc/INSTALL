Howto setup squash to be run.

First, have squash copied into your path.  (But I didn't need to tell you that).

Next setup your configuration file.  There is an example configuration file,
'extra/squash.conf'.  Squash will look in '/etc/squash.conf', '~/squash.conf',
and SQUASH_CONF (environment variable) for configuration settings and in that
order.

Now you need to bulid the database.  The currently provided tools do not support
putting these files in a separate directory tree (even though squash supports
having those files in a separate directory tree).  My suggestion is to fix the
tools or to use tar to move the files after they are created.

To create the database just run import_music.rb with the directory name that
contains your music.  Note you need to run import_music.rb from the same path
as the file musicdb_lib.rb .  Or you can move musicdb_lib.rb into a directory
in your RUBYPATH.

Additionally, support for reading meta information from OGG files directly has
been added recently.  If you only have OGG files you can be lazy and not run
import_music.rb .  MP3 files do not have this support because it is much harder
to add, and so I'm not delaying the release of other features for it.

Now you can run squash.  Please enjoy.
