How to use squash:

Configuration settings:

[Database]
Info_Path=~/music
Stat_Path=~/music
Song_Path=~/music
Masterlist_Filename=
Readonly=1
Save_Info=1
Overwrite_Info=0

The Database section specifies how squash deals with finding your music
and wether and where it will create a database to make loading faster.

Info_Path is the location of the database created by squash.  Stat_Path is
the location of the statistics gathered by squash, in order to pick good
songs for you.  Song_Path is the location of your music.

It is perfectly ok to have all three of these paths overlap.  You may
want to not have them overlap if:
    1) You are a clean-freak and do not like the clutter
       (squash creates a database file and a statistics file
        for each song file it finds).
    2) You are using a filesystem where lots of files slows
       things down.
    3) You may want to use ftp or other simple tool to transfer
       only the songs, info or stat.

Masterlist_Filename is the location of the masterlist, which is a
list of files to use, instead of looking in Song_Path.  Note, that if
Masterlist_Filename is not specified, squash will look in Song_Path.
Also, the list of files in Masterlist_Filename will have Song_Path added
to it.

Readonly affects two things, whether squash will save statistics, and
whether squash will save the current playlist.  This setting is mainly
intended to help debuging.

Save_Info determines whether squash will save database files.
Overwrite_Info will cause squash to overwrite current database files
with the current information in the songs' current tags.

[Global]
Control_Filename=~/.squash_control
Log_Filename=~/.squash_log

Control_Filename determines the name of the control file.  You may send
squash commands like this: echo pause >> ~/.squash_control

Log_Filename is intended for debuging purposes only.  It probably will
not be recognized by a normal installation of squash.

[Playlist]
Filename=~/.squash_playlist
Size=16

[Pastlist]
Size=16

Playlist Filename determines where the playlist is saved after squash
exits.  squash will load these files into the playlist next time it
is run.  (Note: squash will ignore any entries on the playlist that do
not exist in Database Song_Path).

Playlist Size and Pastlist Size determine how many items squash will
try to keep in each window.

Key presses:
Q           Quits Squash.
C           Toggles the spectrum analyzer window on/off and maximized.
P           Toggles the play/paused status.
T           Stops the playing.
S           Skips the currently played song.
E           Edits the currently highlighted song, uses the EDITOR
            environment variable to know what text editor to launch.
I           Toggles the detailed info window on/off
<DEL>       Deletes the current entry (only in the Playlist window).
<TAB>       Changes the currently focused window (between the now
            playing, playlist and pastlist windows).
<ARROW>,    Move in the playlist or pastlist windows.
<HOME/END>,
