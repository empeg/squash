This document describes how to install the libraries needed to get squash
running on an empeg.

I choose to install the libraries by hand.  The libraries needed are:
libmad, tremor (libivorbisdec).  You can get the libraries needed at
these urls:

ftp://ftp.mars.org/pub/mpeg/libmad-0.15.0b.tar.gz
http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/download/tremor_cvs_snapshot.tgz

For libmad use (and then make && make install):
./configure --build=i686-linux-gnu --host=arm-linux --prefix=/usr/local/i686-linux-gnu --enable-static --disable-shared

For tremor (libivorbisdec) use (and then make && make install):
./autogen.sh --build=i686-linux-gnu --host=arm-linux --prefix=/usr/local/i686-linux-gnu --enable-static --disable-shared

I have not tried to install libncurses or libfftw.  If you would like
to try this, you may reenable these features in the Makefile (it's
near the top by ifdef EMPEG).

If you do compile ncurses, you would have the empeg display, the control
fifo -and- the ncurses display all running at once!

If you compile the fftw library, you will have the spectrum analyzer
running on the ncurses interface only (as of now).  Also, the StrongARM
may not be able to handle the floating point calculations that the fftw
library will try to do.
