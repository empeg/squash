Please see the regular USERS_GUIDE for configuration settings, and the
empeg/INSTALL file for how to get squash running on the empeg.

Once squash is running the current keymap is this:

UP          Play/Pause
LEFT        Stop
RIGHT       Skip
DOWN        Quit
KNOB LEFT   Lower volume
KNOW RIGHT  Raise volume

Please note that you will probably want to use the [database]
masterlist_filename option to speed load times.  However, if you change
what music is on the empeg, you must delete this file for squash to notice
the new files.  (It will probably crash too if you do not).  You can
have squash regenerate the file for you (which takes a little while if
you have USE_MAGIC support), or you can just generate it yourself,

Assuming you have a copy of the music you have send to the player on
your local linux box this should work:

find the_music -type f \( -iname '*.mp3' -or -iname '*.ogg' \) -printf
"%P\n" > squash_masterlist

The masterlist must only contain existing files, and these files must
be either mp3s or oggs.  Otherwise squash will probably bomb.
