This lists what features have not been completed for the empeg port
of squash.

Better sound driver
    Squash currently only plays 44.1khz, stereo 16 bit little endian
    streams, because the current sound driver is not advanced and is
    limited to the empeg's DSP's preferred format.
Spectrum analyzer port
Confirmation for player quit
Call sync after writes (?)
