This document describes how to install additional programs you probably
will want or need with squash on an empeg.

You need to install a dhcp client, in order to have the empeg setup it's
network interface (the original player used to do this for you).

I choose dhcpcd because I was having problems with pump when using the
debian toolchain.  However, the hijack toolchain could probably compile
pump correctly; feel free to try it out.

You can get dhcpcd from this url:

http://www.phystech.com/ftp/dhcpcd-1.3.22-pl4.tar.gz

To build, use this if you have the hijack toolchain:

./configure --build=i686-linux-gnu --host=arm-empeg-linux --prefix=/usr/local/i686-arm-cross

Or this if you have the debian toolchain:

./configure --build=i686-linux-gnu --host=arm-linux --prefix=/usr/local/i686-linux-gnu

Also (for the debian toolchain only) edit the Makefile and add "-static"
to the end of the "LDFLAGS=" line.

Next run make.

You then need to copy the dhcpcd executable to the empeg's /bin directory.
Please see INSTALL_EMPEG for details.
