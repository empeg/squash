This document describes how to install additional programs you probably
will want or need with squash on an empeg.

You need to install a dhcp client, in order to have the empeg setup it's
network interface (the original player used to do this for you).

I choose dhcpcd because I was having problems with pump.  (I believe
my toolchain is not perfect yet and both the tremor library and pump
manifest this problem).

You can get dhcpcd from this url:
http://www.phystech.com/ftp/dhcpcd-1.3.22-pl4.tar.gz

To build use:
./configure --build=i686-linux-gnu --host=arm-linux --prefix=/usr/local/i686-linux-gnu --enable-static --disable-shared

You then need to copy the dhcpcd executable to the empeg's /bin directory.
Please see INSTALL_EMPEG for details.
