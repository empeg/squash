In order to install squash onto the empeg, you will need a toolchain
for your computer which can compile programs for the empeg (which is
a strongARM).  You maybe able to find one that works on the internet.
This document describes the steps necessary to install one on a debian
system using debian's tools.

1) Goto http://people.debian.org/~debacle/cross.html .  This guide
worked for me and I will be following it.  One problem I had with
it was that he did not specify all packages that needed to be installed.
I will try to mention those extra packages here.  I may have left some
out, please let me know.

2) apt-get install toolchain-source debconf debhelper autoconf2.13 fakeroot

3) edit /etc/dpkg/cross-compile, set "crossbase" to "/usr".

4) cd /usr/src && EMAIL='asdf@asdf.com' tpkg-make arm-linux

5) cd binutils-arm-linux-*/ && DEBUILD_DPKG_BUILDPACKAGE_OPTS="-us -uc" debuild && debi

6) cd /usr/src && tpkg-install-libc arm-linux

7) cd gcc-arm-linux-* , then edit debian/rules make these two changes:
    I) Under CONFARGS, change --enable-languages=c, to --enable-languages="c c++"
    II) Under build: and #Add here commands..., add the line:
        cp -a src/libstdc++-v3/config/os/{gnu-linux/bits,newlib/}
    Note: These steps are necessary to build libFLAC support which requires a working
          c++ toolchain.

9) DEBUILD_DPKG_BUILDPACKAGE_OPTS="-us -uc" debuild && debi

8) Rejoice, or if you have error messages bang head on monitor to summon
the computer spirits of long past (perhaps they'll aid you, or maybe
just demand pizza and caffeine).
